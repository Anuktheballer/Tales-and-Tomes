      "date": "2025-02-24",
      "summary": "Project Hail Mary is a 5/5 read",
      "content": "<p>Project Hail Mary was a fantastic read, blending hard science with a deeply emotional and engaging story. The novel follows Ryland Grace, who wakes up alone on a spaceship with no memory, only to slowly uncover that he was sent on a desperate mission to save Earth from an existential threat. However, the true highlight of the book was Rocky, the brilliant and lovable Eridian alien who forms an unlikely yet heartwarming friendship with Grace. Their teamwork and communication, built through sheer intelligence and perseverance, made the book incredibly compelling. Every scientific challenge they faced, from language barriers to engineering solutions, felt meticulously crafted and deeply rewarding. The ending, where Grace chooses to stay behind and teach Eridian children rather than return to Earth, was the perfect conclusion—bittersweet yet satisfying. Seeing him embrace his role as a teacher again, but this time on a completely different world, was the icing on the cake of an already phenomenal novel.</p>"

        "date": "2025-02-07",
        "summary": "M.L. Wang's The Sword of Kaigen is 5/5 read",
        "content": "<p>M.L. Wang's The Sword of Kaigen is an extraordinary fantasy novel that left an indelible mark on me. From the moment I started reading, I was captivated by the beautifully crafted world, the complex characters, and the intense emotions woven into every page. This book is a masterclass in storytelling, and it's one that I'll be thinking about for a long time.</p><p>First and foremost, the character arcs in this novel are nothing short of phenomenal. Wang has an incredible talent for creating multi-dimensional characters who feel so real and relatable. Misaki, the matriarch of the Matsuda family, is a standout character whose journey from a dutiful wife to a fierce warrior is both heartbreaking and inspiring. Her struggles, sacrifices, and growth are portrayed with such depth that I found myself cheering for her every step of the way. Mamoru, her son, is another brilliantly developed character. Watching him grapple with his identity and the weight of familial expectations was both painful and uplifting. And then there's Takeru, Misaki's husband, whose complex and layered personality adds another dimension to the story. His internal conflicts, sense of duty, and deep love for his family make him a compelling and memorable character. These character arcs are the emotional core of the story, and they resonate deeply.</p><p>The plot of The Sword of Kaigen is meticulously crafted and gripping from start to finish. The pacing is masterful, and the blend of action, intrigue, and emotional moments kept me on the edge of my seat. The stakes are high, and the tension is palpable, making it impossible to put the book down. However, I have to admit that the last chapter left me feeling a bit conflicted. While the majority of the plot was almost perfect, the resolution felt slightly rushed. Additionally, the final chapter with Robin seemed to add more questions than answers, leaving some plot threads unresolved and creating a sense of incompleteness. I wanted more closure and a bit more time to savor the culmination of such an epic journey. It's a minor flaw in an otherwise outstanding narrative, but it did leave me yearning for just a bit more.</p><p>The premise of the book—exploring the intersection of tradition, honor, and personal growth in a richly imagined world—is executed with brilliance. Wang's world-building is immersive and detailed, transporting readers to a place that feels both familiar and fantastical. The themes of sacrifice, courage, and self-discovery are interwoven seamlessly, making the story both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant. I found myself reflecting on these themes long after I finished the book.</p><p>One of the lingering thoughts I had after closing the book was a deep desire for a sequel. The world Wang has created is so vivid and compelling that I couldn't help but wish for more stories set in it. The characters have so much more to explore, and their journeys feel far from over. A second book could delve deeper into the aftermath of the events in The Sword of Kaigen and further develop the rich tapestry of this world. I genuinely hope that Wang considers continuing this incredible story.</p><p>In conclusion, The Sword of Kaigen is a remarkable novel that excels in character development, world-building, and thematic depth. While the ending may leave some readers wanting more, it remains a powerful and memorable story that deserves a place on every fantasy lover's bookshelf. M.L. Wang has crafted a tale that resonates on multiple levels, and I eagerly hope for a continuation of this fantastic journey.</p>"

      "date": "2025-02-04",
      "summary": "The Will of the Many could be start of the greatest trilogy in fantasy",
      "content": "<p>This was my first fantasy book in ten years, and I fear I may have set the bar too high. The plot was so masterfully crafted that I never saw the twists and turns coming—James Islington wove them in seamlessly. Vis, as a protagonist, was cunning and always aware of when he was in over his head. His intelligence wasn’t just about quick thinking but knowing when to push forward and when to pull back. The story kept me hooked from start to finish, leaving me in awe of how effortlessly it all unfolded. The last 100 chapters and the epilogue made me stand up in awe with what had transpired. I compel everyone to read this and truly enjoy the world James has built here. I can’t wait for book 2!</p>"

      "summary": "Babel boasts a brilliant premise and worldbuilding but ultimately falls short due to dull characters and an underutilized magic system, leaving it a middling 3/5 read.",
      "content": "<p>I really wanted to love Babel. The premise is incredible—language, colonialism, and a unique magic system based on translation? That’s right up my alley. And for the first chunk of the book, I was hooked. The worldbuilding is detailed, the themes are powerful, and the magic system is so well thought out. But the further I got, the more I realized something was missing: the characters.</p><p> They just felt… dull. I kept waiting to feel truly connected to them, to care about their struggles beyond an abstract level, but it never really happened. The story had all this potential, but the characters didn’t bring it to life. The magic system, as brilliant as it was conceptually, also ended up feeling underutilized, like it was there more for thematic weight than for actual plot impact.</p><p> Ramy was the one exception. He had personality, energy, and a real spark that made me want to keep reading. But then—of course—he dies. And after that, my motivation to finish the book pretty much died with him.</p><p> At the end of the day, Babel is just… mid. There’s so much that could have made it great, but it never quite gets there. 3/5.</p>"

      "summary": "Red Rising is a brutal and gripping tale of revenge, following Darrow’s ruthless transformation and infiltration of the elite Golds in a high-stakes battle for power.",
      "content": "<p>Red Rising is a brutal, gripping story that pulls you in right from the start. The revenge plot is hands down one of my favorite aspects—Darrow’s transformation and infiltration of the elite Golds is both ruthless and deeply satisfying. Watching him navigate their world, outmaneuver his enemies, and slowly build his power kept me hooked the entire time. Pierce Brown’s writing is sharp, fast-paced, and cinematic, making every moment feel high-stakes and immersive. That said, I did feel like the whole Institute test dragged a little at times—there were moments where the pacing slowed, and I was ready for things to move forward. But that’s just a personal opinion, and I can see why it was necessary for Darrow’s development. Overall, I loved the book, and I can’t wait to keep reading the series to see how Darrow’s revenge unfolds.</p>"

        "summary": "A Fresh Start in a new town, I wonder what this town has to offer!", 
        "content": "<p>Joseph had only been in Paris, Texas, for a few days, and already he felt like he didn’t belong. The town was small, the heat relentless, and the whispers of the unfamiliar halls at school left him feeling like a stranger. As the first week of the new school year began, he told himself he needed to find something—anything—to anchor him here.</p><p>He wandered the school grounds during lunch, a flyer clutched in his hand advertising the club's fair. Rows of booths lined the main courtyard, bustling with students handing out candy and shouting slogans, but nothing caught his eye. Sports, debate, drama—he wasn’t even sure what he was looking for. Thirty minutes later, he found himself at the edge of the school grounds, ready to give up.</p><p>And then he saw her.</p><p>A girl sat alone under the shade of an old oak tree, her shoulders slouched and her head bowed. Her chair was positioned beside a folding table, which held a stack of pristine white flyers and a few carefully arranged photographs. The glossy images caught the light filtering through the leaves, showcasing moments frozen in time—an empty street at dawn, a flower blooming through cracked pavement, and the soft silhouette of a child against a sunset. Unlike the chaos of the courtyard, the scene was still and quiet, almost eerie.</p><p>Joseph approached cautiously, catching the faint shimmer of tears on her cheeks. Her red-rimmed eyes looked up at him, startled but soft.</p><p>“What club are you representing?” he asked, his voice gentle but curious.</p><p>“The Photography Club,” she replied, her tone barely above a whisper. She held out a single flyer, her hand trembling slightly. “We… don’t have any members.”</p><p>Joseph stared at the flyer, the bold black letters standing out starkly against the blank white paper: See the world through a different lens. Something about the words struck him, a quiet pull in his chest. His gaze shifted to the photos neatly arranged on the table—a flower blooming through cracked pavement, an empty street bathed in the soft glow of dawn, and the silhouette of a child against a blazing sunset. Each image seemed to hold a secret, a story waiting to be uncovered. His eyes lingered on one in particular, a shot of an old alley with graffiti that felt strangely familiar, though he couldn’t place why.</p><p>“I’ve decided to join the Photography Club,” he said, the words surprising even himself.</p><p>Her eyes widened, the sadness on her face momentarily giving way to something unreadable—disbelief, or perhaps recognition. “You’re serious?”</p><p>He smiled, the smallest hint of mischief creeping into his expression. “Why not? Someone’s got to keep you company under this tree.”</p><p>Her cheeks flushed, and she stood quickly, the flyer forgotten in her hand. “You and I are the only members of the club at the moment. Are you sure you want to join?”</p><p>“Positive,” Joseph said, his smile widening. “Besides, maybe we’ll even find a few more people. And if not… I think we’ll be just fine.”</p><p>She blinked at him, as if she couldn’t quite believe what she was hearing, before finally breaking into a radiant smile. “My name’s Tessa. What’s yours?”</p><p>“Joseph,” he answered, tucking the flyer into his pocket.</p><p>For the first time since he’d arrived in Paris, he felt something close to belonging.</p><p>Later that day, Joseph was making his way to class when the chatter of students around him started to buzz louder. As he stepped into the hallway, his eyes immediately found Tessa. She was surrounded by a small group of friends, her laughter ringing out above the noise. She had an effortless charm, the kind that made her stand out without even trying.</p><p>Joseph watched as she moved through the crowd with a natural ease, greeting nearly everyone she passed. People seemed to light up when she spoke to them, like her attention was a gift they were lucky to receive. She wore a stylish outfit—effortless but put-together in a way that screamed confidence—and carried herself with the kind of assurance that Joseph could only dream of.</p><p>Meanwhile, Joseph adjusted the strap of his worn-out backpack, the frayed edges brushing against his shoulder. His jeans were a little too long, the hems scuffed from dragging against the ground, and his sneakers were a faded shade of gray that spoke of years of use. He kept his head down as he passed groups of students who didn’t even glance his way.</p><p>“Afternoon, Tessa!” someone called out cheerfully.</p><p>“Hey!” she replied with a wave, flashing a bright smile that seemed to make the hallway a little lighter. Joseph felt a pang of something—was it admiration? Envy? Whatever it was, it made the space between them feel impossibly vast.</p><p>As he slipped into his next class, he nearly dropped his books when he saw Tessa take a seat near the window. She caught his gaze and waved casually, as if they’d been friends forever.</p><p>“Joseph! Looks like we’re in the same class,” she said brightly.</p><p>He nodded, feeling his throat tighten. “Yeah, looks like it.”</p><p>Throughout the class, Joseph couldn’t help but notice how easily Tessa interacted with everyone around her. People leaned toward her desk to ask for her opinion or to share a joke. She seemed to know all the answers, not just to the teacher’s questions but to the unspoken rules of how to belong, how to fit in.</p><p>Joseph, on the other hand, kept to himself. He was used to fading into the background, content to observe rather than participate. He’d learned long ago that attention often came with strings, and he couldn’t afford any unnecessary complications in his life.</p><p>By the end of class, Joseph had a better understanding of what made Tessa stand out. She wasn’t just popular—she was admired. People seemed to see her as untouchable, a beacon of light in the otherwise mundane routine of school life.</p>"
